# iSponsorBlock

A jailbreak tweak that implements the SponsorBlock API to skip sponsorships in youtube vidoes.

More info about SponsorBlock and the API used can be found [here](https://sponsor.ajay.app).

This tweak has been tested on the latest YouTube version (15.12) and also on older versions including, 15.06 and 15.08. It has only been tested on iOS 13.3.

iSponsorBlock does not interfere with Cercube. It doesn't work with downloaded videos on Cercube; although, this feature will hopefully be coming soon.
