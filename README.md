# iSponsorBlock
A jailbreak tweak that implements the sponsorblock api to skip sponsorships in youtube vidoes.
DISCLAIMER: This tweak does not function properly at the moment and is experimental. If you really want to test it you can compile from source, but it is not ready to be shipped to the public yet.
