make MLHAMPlayerInstance like this:
[[MLHAMPlayer alloc] initWithVideo:MLVideoInstance playerConfig:MLInnerTubePlayerConfigInstance stickySettings:MLPlayerStickySettingsInstance playerView:MLHAMIOSurfaceMainThreadRenderingViewInstance frameSourceDelegate:MLHAMIOSurfaceMainThreadRenderingViewInstance];

also need to NSLog all the init methods of classes being pumped into initWithVideo to make sure that they actually get called lel.
